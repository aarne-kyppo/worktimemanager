worktimemanager
===============

Worktime-manager made with Python and PyQt

This application may be higly customized, because this is made to help me to mark working time. This application will be updated to be the best(maybe) worktimemanager ever made. I have also little experience about mobile programming, so in future there may be also versions for mobile platforms also. This application is not cloud service, and it is based on simple textfiles. I strongly assume that I am reinventing the wheel, but my main purpose is to fill my portfolio. 

Install script is only for linux. Install script for Windows is coming in future.
When you use install or uninstall script, you should run it with your account, not root. So check if your account name is printed to terminal while you are running script.
